# VRV Security Project

This is a Next.js application developed for an assignment at **VRV Security**. The project consists of both a frontend and backend that work together to provide a secure and responsive web application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Run the Development Server

First, clone this repository and navigate into the project directory. Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

The page will automatically update as you make changes to the files.

#Frontend
The frontend is built using Next.js, providing a modern and responsive user interface. Key features of the frontend include:

A clean and simple design optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
A dynamic layout that adjusts based on user roles and permissions.
Integration with the backend for secure data fetching.

#Folder Structure
The app/ folder contains pages, components, and styles for the frontend.

#Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and communicates with a PostgreSQL database. It handles user authentication, role management, and data operations securely.

#Database Configuration
In the .env file, you will find the following environment variables used for connecting to the PostgreSQL database and setting up JWT authentication:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your url"
JWT_SECRET="secret_key"

```

DATABASE_URL: This is the connection string used to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
JWT_SECRET: This secret key is used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
About the Project
This project is focused on providing a secure web application with the following features:

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using JWT tokens.

Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles (e.g., Admin, User) with distinct permissions.

Dynamic User Interface: The frontend adapts based on the user's role, offering an intuitive user experience.
